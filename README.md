<h1> my initial thoughts - *week 1 task* </h1>

my initial thoughts for this project is to use a genre. I believe that using Rock, Pop or acoustic will aloow me access many different files with different data sets to allow me to easily compare and contrast the data and their uses.

<h1> I chose the Rock genre </h1>

The genre of Rock is slightly subjective currently, however, on free music archive there are thousands of samples of music placed within their description of "Rock"
This gives me access to metadata within the acoustic and desctiptive data section and helps for later comparisons within the music.
