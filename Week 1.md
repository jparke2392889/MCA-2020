<h1> my initial thoughts - *week 1 task* </h1>

my initial thoughts for this project is to use a genre. I believe that using Rock, Pop or acoustic will aloow me access many different files with different data sets to allow me to easily compare and contrast the data and their uses.

<h1> I chose to look into what defines a genre in general. </h1>

I chose to use several different genres and look into if there is any defining characterisitics within their music that makes it appear to fit one genre over another. To do this i chose to use genres that society considers to be on the opposite ends of the spectrum. This is why i chose Pop, Blues and Dance tracks to show the differences between genres.
